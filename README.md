2. **[Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/code4Y/tic-tac-toe) :**   
   A fun little game created in JavaScript 🔥 with an elegant modern design! 🌸
  
3. **[Jump Game LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100_Day_Of_Code/tree/main/Day-3) :** 🐸  
   We are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Return true if we can reach the last index, or false otherwise.
  
4. **[Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100_Day_Of_Code/tree/main/Day-4) :** :moneybag:  
   We are given two arrays capacity and rocks. The ith bag can hold a maximum of capacity[i] rocks and currently contains rocks[i] rocks. We are also given an integer additionalRocks, we can place it in any of the bags. Return the maximum number of bags that could have full capacity after placing the additional rocks in some bags.  
   
5. **[Remove Stones to Minimize the Total LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-5) :** :cookie:  
   We are given an array piles, where piles[i] is number of stones in ith pile, and an integer k. Choose any piles[i] and remove floor(piles[i] / 2) stones from it. We should apply this operation exactly k times and return the minimum possible total number of stones.  
   
6. **[Regular Expression Matching LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-6) :** 😃!=😭  
   Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with ```'.'``` for any single character and ```'*'``` for zero or more of the preceding element. The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial) and return true or false.  
   
7. **[Design Circular Queue LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-7) :** :recycle:  
   Design circular queue, it is a linear data structure, which follows FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer". By using circular queue, we can utlize empty spaces in front of the queue.
  
8. **[Word Pattern LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-8) :**  :jigsaw:  
   Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern. Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.
