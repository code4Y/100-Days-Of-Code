### Collection Index :
1. **[Rangoli Generative Art](https://github.com/code4Y/rangoli-generative-art) :**  
   JavaScript project created on the auspicious day of Diwali festival ‚ú®, to celebrate Rangoli üå∏ in a Digital manner using Generative Art.  
   
2. **[Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/code4Y/tic-tac-toe) :**   
   A fun little game created in JavaScript üî• with an elegant modern design! üå∏
  
3. **[Jump Game LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100_Day_Of_Code/tree/main/Day-3) :** üê∏  
   We are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. Return true if we can reach the last index, or false otherwise.
  
4. **[Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100_Day_Of_Code/tree/main/Day-4) :** :moneybag:  
   We are given two arrays capacity and rocks. The ith bag can hold a maximum of capacity[i] rocks and currently contains rocks[i] rocks. We are also given an integer additionalRocks, we can place it in any of the bags. Return the maximum number of bags that could have full capacity after placing the additional rocks in some bags.  
   
5. **[Remove Stones to Minimize the Total LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-5) :** :cookie:  
   We are given an array piles, where piles[i] is number of stones in ith pile, and an integer k. Choose any piles[i] and remove floor(piles[i] / 2) stones from it. We should apply this operation exactly k times and return the minimum possible total number of stones.  
   
6. **[Regular Expression Matching LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-6) :** üòÉ!=üò≠  
   Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with ```'.'``` for any single character and ```'*'``` for zero or more of the preceding element. The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial) and return true or false.  
   
7. **[Design Circular Queue LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-7) :** :recycle:  
   Design circular queue, it is a linear data structure, which follows FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer". By using circular queue, we can utlize empty spaces in front of the queue.
  
8. **[Word Pattern LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-8) :**  :jigsaw:  
   Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern. Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.  
   
9. **[Detect Capital LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-9) :** :scroll:  
   We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the case is followed: all letters capital, all letters not capital or only first letter capital. Given a string ```word```, return ```true``` if the usage of capitals is right.  

10. **[Container With Most Water LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-10) :** :droplet:  
    Given an array ```height``` of length ```n```. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ```i```<sup>```th```</sup> line are ```(i, 0)``` and ```(i, height[i])```. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that it contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.  
    
11. **[Delete Columns to Make Sorted LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-11) :** :wastebasket:  
    Given an array of ```n``` strings ```strs```, all of the same length. The strings could form a grid. For example,```strs=["abc", "bce", "cae"]```. We want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically and return the number of columns.  
    
12. **[Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-12) :** :repeat::white_check_mark:  
    Given an array ```tasks```, where ```tasks[i]``` represents the difficulty level of a task. In each round, you can complete either 2 or 3 tasks of the same difficulty level. Return the minimum rounds required to complete all the tasks, or ```-1``` if it is not possible to complete all the tasks.  

13. **[Largest Number LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-13) :** :100:  
    Given a list of non-negative integers ```nums```, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it. Since the result may be very large, so we need to return a string instead of an integer.  
    
14. **[Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons LeetCode](https://github.com/code4Y/100-Days-Of-Code/tree/main/Day-14) :** :dart::balloon:  
    There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array, where each element represents a range on the x-axis. Arrows can be shot up from the x-axis to burst the balloons. Find the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all the balloons.
